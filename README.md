# Coub error pages
This project was originally created as a mockery of "modern" web developers who break their crappy one-page website into dozens of modules with 10 lines of code in each, most of which are not used or not needed, add tons of useless console.log to every shit they launch, and also at the same time they overload page with all sorts of unnecessary visual and functional garbage

---

### Features:
- Detailed logging of each stage of code execution in the console.
- Extensible localization system.
- Modern client-side rendering.
- The ability to share a link to the error page with a specific Coub.
- 3 copyright notes.

### How to add to your website:
```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/TheSainEyereg/Coub-error-pages errorPages
#or
git clone https://github.com/TheSainEyereg/Coub-error-pages errorPages
```
_p.s. Note that "errorPages" directory should be in the root of your website_
